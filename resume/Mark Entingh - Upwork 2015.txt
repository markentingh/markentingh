I am a full-stack developer capable of doing exactly what you need, on time, with excellent communication, working from Washington, USA. I've been developing ASP.net sites since 2005, and have natural artistic talent for graphic design, interface design, & icon design using Photoshop & Flash. I can work with any version of ASP.net, 2.0, 3.5, 4.5, and even the new 4.6 vNext CoreCLR (for Linux & Mac OSX), using either web forms or MVC or any CMS of your choice. I've been developing my own CMS using ASP.net 4.5 & VB.net (www.rennder.com), and I'm converting the project for open source using ASP.net vNext & C# (www.github.com/rennder/home).
