While having all the required skills along with a multitude of knowledge & experience with building web applications, I would most definitely be able to help build, optimize, and launch your software projects.

My colleagues see me as a leader, highly spirited and outspoken, and a creative individual, so I believe to be a positive addition to any team.

My strengths include developing highly complex Javascript & .net features, optimizing websites for cross-browser compatibility all the way back to IE6, and recognizing user experience flaws within software interfaces.




Before getting funded for my own startup, I worked for Marriott Vacation Club in Orlando as an HTML / CSS expert for $45k a year. My ideal salary for this position would be $120,000 for all the experience you require, yet I would be happy to work with $90,000. This is definitely a great opportunity for me.
