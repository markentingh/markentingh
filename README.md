## Hey there,
### I'm Mark Entingh, a software engineer and one man army on the front-lines of open source.

I'm currently working on various projects of my own, for the sake of my own sanity. :blush:

* I use [Kandu](https://www.github.com/Datasilk/Kandu) every day to keep track of all the things. Looks a lot like Trello, doesn't it? That's because I love Trello, but I'm selfish and wanted to keep it for myself, so I built my own Trello from scratch and even made it better in some ways.

* I use [Legendary](https://www.github.com/Datasilk/Legendary) every day to write down my thoughts and to keep track of a journal, private data, passwords, accounts, etc. I used ChaCha20 encryption to encrypt all data that goes into Legendary, so it's safe to say that all my data is safe. Also, Legendary looks a lot like Evernote, doesn't it? That's because I really liked the design aesthetic of Evernote but I wanted to keep it for myself, so I built my own Evernote from scratch and even made it better than Evernote could ever be (since Evernote has a paywall).

* I use [Saber](https://www.github.com/Datasilk/Saber) to design & develop various static websites that I maintain. It looks a lot like Visual Studio Code, doesn't it? That's because I'm using the Monaco Editor, which is also used in Visual Studio Code. I love this project because it is the 4th (or 5th) time I've tried developing a CMS platform within the past 20 years I've been a web developer, and so this project is the culmination of all the mistakes I've made, lessons I've learned, and hardships I've gone through over the years trying to develop the perfect CMS. The cool part about Saber is the fact that I can edit web pages from the live website and navigate to any URL within the site, even URLs that don't neccessarily exist yet, and start editing HTML, JS, & LESS in the Monaco editor.

* I use [Datasilk Core](https://www.github.com/Datasilk/Core) middleware in all my ASP.NET Core MVC projects to replace Microsoft's MVC middleware. It's much more light-weight and takes a different approach to handling Controllers a lot like how React handles components with a single `Render()` method. Also, instead of using Razor, Datasilk Core utilizes its own View class that binds C# objects to mustache variables within HTML. As a result, controllers as super small & light-weight, views look more like HTML than spaghetti-code, and my entire development process for MVC projects are straight-forward and quick to prototype.

* I use [Selector](https://www.github.com/Websilk/Selector) as a jQuery replacement that weighs in at under 5kb (gzip + minified). I wrote this library to help me fully understand the limitations of JavaScript and so that I could use something smaller than jQuery and Zepto in my web projects.

* I use [Tapestry](https://www.github.com/Websilk/Tapestry) as a LESS/CSS grid & UI framework for most of my web projects. It's really easy to build responsive grids of any kind (including odd-numbered column grids of 5, 7, and 9), has a really robust and minimal set of UI elements, and uses LESS to define colors for UI elements and themes.

There are many more projects that I'm working on at the moment, even a few that are private because I plan on monitizing them so that I don't have to rely on a day job any longer. Eventually I'll talk about those projects once they're released to the public. For now, if you'd like to get to know me, you can find me on **Discord** @ **polymath#3455**.

Thank you for taking the time to read all this stuff and I hope we can talk in the near future if you're interested in picking my brain.
